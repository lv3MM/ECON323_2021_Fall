## Quantitative Economic Modeling with Data Science Applications

- **Instructor:**
  - Section 2: Peifan Wu, wupeifan@mail.ubc.ca
  - Section 3: Paul Schrimpf, schrimpf@mail.ubc.ca
- **Textbook:** [QuantEcon DataScience](https://datascience.quantecon.org/)


## Course Overview
This is a course introducing the computational and data science tools used in modern economics.

We will apply a programming language (Python) to analyzing these sorts of
data and making numerical calculations/simulations of models in economics.

Classes for Section 2 will be held in-person in [BUCH
D317](https://ssc.adm.ubc.ca/classroomservices/function/viewlocation?userEvent=ShowLocation&buildingID=BUCH&roomID=D317)
on Tuesdays and Thursdays 3:30pm-5:00pm.
Classes for Section 3 will be held in-person in [EOS
135](https://ssc.adm.ubc.ca/classroomservices/function/viewlocation?userEvent=ShowLocation&buildingID=EOS&roomID=135)
on Mondays and Wednesdays 1:30pm-2:50pm.

For students who cannot
attend in person, classes will also be available on zoom, through
http://canvas.ubc.ca

Provincial Health Orders and UBC policy now mandate masks in all
indoor public spaces on campus. These spaces include classrooms,
residence halls, libraries, and common areas.

## UBC values and policies

UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious and cultural observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions. Details of the policies and how to access support are available here (https://senate.ubc.ca/policiesresources-support-student-success)
